          the <a href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/" target="_blank">Hong Kong Companies Ordinance</a>
          and the Company’s Articles of Association, the Company supplies Corporate Communications (other than Actionable
          Corporate Communication) to shareholders by electronic means through the website of the Company and the
          <a href="https://www.hkexnews.hk/index.htm" target="_blank">HKEXnews website</a>
          (“Electronic Version”).
        </div>
        <div>
          Where a Corporate Communication is issued to seek instructions from the registered shareholders on how they wish
          to exercise their rights or make an election as shareholders (“Actionable Corporate Communication”), the
          Actionable Corporate Communication will be sent to registered shareholders individually to the email addresses
          provided by the registered shareholders, or if the Company does not receive
          a functional email address of the registered shareholders, such Actionable Corporate Communication will be sent
          in printed form by post to the shareholders’ addresses as they appear in the Company’s register of members
          together with a request form for soliciting the registered shareholders’ functional email address to facilitate
          electronic dissemination of Actionable Corporate Communications in the future.  For the avoidance of doubt,
          Actionable Corporate Communications do not include notices of general meetings and proxy forms.
        </div>
        <div>
          The Company will seek functional email address from each new registered shareholder to receiving the Electronic
          Version of all future Corporate Communications. To promote electronic dissemination of Corporate Communications,
          the registered shareholders are required to make a further request in writing to the Hong Kong Branch Share
          Registrar upon the annual expiry of the previous request to receive Corporate
          Communications in printed form, if they wish to continue to do so.  
        </div>
        <div>To ensure timely receipt of the latest Corporate Communications, the Company recommends the registered
          shareholders to provide their email address by scanning their personalized QR code printed on the reply form
          (the “Reply Form”) sent to them individually. Alternatively, the registered shareholders may sign and return the
          Reply Form to the Hong Kong Branch Share Registrar, Computershare Hong Kong Investor Services Limited, at 17M
          Floor, Hopewell Centre, 183 Queen’s Road East, Wan Chai, Hong Kong. </div>
        <div>If the registered shareholders want to receive the Corporate Communications in printed form, please complete
          the Reply Form and send it to the Hong Kong Branch Share Registrar, Computershare Hong Kong Investor Services
          Limited, at 17M Floor, Hopewell Centre, 183 Queen’s Road East, Wan Chai, Hong Kong or send an email to
          cmereye.ecom@computershare.com.hk specifying their name, address and request to receive the Corporate
          Communications in printed form. Please note that such instruction shall be valid for one year starting from the
          receipt date of their instruction and will expire thereafter. If the registered shareholders wish to continue to
          receive Corporate Communications in printed form, they are required to make a further request in writing to the
          Hong Kong Branch Share Registrar upon expiry.
