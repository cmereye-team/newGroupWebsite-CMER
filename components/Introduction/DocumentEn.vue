The medical network includes more than 40 specialty and other healthcare institutions in Hong Kong.

        To satisfy the growing public demand for specialty services, C-MER has formulated the “Eye+” growth strategy to expand its scope of business beyond ophthalmic service to multiple specialty medical services. In Hong Kong, the Group’s business has been extended to encompass ophthalmology, dentistry, plastic surgery/medical aesthetics, family medicine and oncology. C-MER also ventures into China’s dental market by duplicating its well-proven business model of ophthalmic service. It creates significant synergy with ophthalmic service to outreach their target customer groups.
